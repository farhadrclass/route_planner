		self.paragraph(r"The troposphere is the lowest atmospheric layer and of significant interest to meteorological researchers as ``almost all weather develops in the troposphere'' \cite{NatGeo}. The section of the troposphere that is closest to the earth is the atmospheric boundary layer, in this layer the atmospheric conditions are affected by the surface of the earth. These effects mean that modelling this section is much more complicated than other layers of the atmosphere, therefore ``the boundary layer is still not represented realistically'' \cite{Teixeira2008}. Developing a greater understanding and thus better modelling of the atmospheric boundary layer will improve the ability to predict weather patterns and pollutant dispersion, to name but two benefits.")
		self.paragraph(r"To collect atmospheric data a number of approaches have been used historically, ``many years before the use of radio-controlled aircraft, the collection of in-situ measurements was primarily done with balloons, towers, and tethersondes' \cite{Bonin2011}. These options were limited as they were not able to move within the area of interest to build a model. UAVs operate with ``reduced human risk, but also reduced weight and cost, increased endurance, and a vehicle design not limited by human physiology'' \cite{Pepper2012} in comparison to their manned counterparts. This means they provide a cheap and mobile data collection platform.")
		self.paragraph(r"There are 5 main classes of UAV for different requirements \cite{Sarris2001}; the class of UAV best suited to collecting atmospheric data of a limited area is the close range class. This class of UAV: ``require minimum manpower, training, and logistics, and will be relatively inexpensive'' \cite{FasDod}. These benefits allow a greater number of researchers to have access to mobile data collecting platforms. Most small UAVs are ``not capable of reaching above 5,000ft [1524m]'' \cite{Weibel2005} with their maximum range being less than 10km \cite{Blyenburgh2000}.")

The TSP is concerned with ``finding the shortest path joining all of a finite set of points whose distances from each other are given'' \cite{Held1984}. The TSP problem considered in these papers uses the euclidean distance where the ``euclidean distances satisfy the triangle inequality'' \cite{DeBerg2010}; ``The triangle inequality implies that no reasonable salesman would ever revisit the same city: instead of returning to a city, it is always cheaper to skip the city and to travel directly to the successor city'' \cite{DeBerg2010}.

Both papers found that the minimum path is comprised of maximum rate turns and straight line segments. This initial work on shortest paths is extended by \citen{Chitsaz2007} to take a third dimension into account: for low altitude ranges the shortest path is the Dubins path in the x-y plane and a constant rate altitude climb. High altitude climbs diverged from the Dubins path due to helical climbing component; however this is not relevant as only low altitude climbs are considered in this project.")
		self.paragraph(r"\citen{McGee2005,Techy2009} apply Dubins shortest path in uniform wind. This is done by considering a ground reference frame and wind reference frame which results in the Dubins minimum path being calculated in the wind reference frame. The maximum rate turns in the air frame of reference ``correspond to trochoidal paths in the inertial (ground) frame'' \cite{Techy2009}. Assuming uniform and time-invariant wind leads to potential inaccuracies which are considered through using 'a turning rate less than the actual maximum turning rate' \cite{McGee2005}. Both papers considered utilise different approaches to obtain a final optimal path, though the resulting optimal paths are both comprised of a combination of trochoidal path sections and straight line sections. These papers present an extension of the Dubins path concept to consider wind but also outline the added complexity of uniform wind without resulting in a vastly different path.")
		self.paragraph(r"\citen{Savla2005a,Savla2005,LeNy2008} consider the DTSP. The basic approach considered in all papers is in the form of the alternating algorithm which requires calculation of a minimum tour using euclidean distances for an initial ordering. From the initial order the heading at nodes is given by the direction of either the vertex before the node or the vertex after the node. With the order, location and heading defined at each point the Dubins shortest path can be calculated. \citen{Savla2005} goes on to consider stochastic DTSP where the points are normally distributed and puts forth a bead tilling algorithm to improve the performance which is an important consideration for the initial planning aspect of this paper. \citen{LeNy2008} however goes beyond the scope of this paper in considering variable vehicle dynamics.")

The given equations of energy and considerations of optimal routes through complex wind fields applies directly to this paper; however attempting to tap into soaring flight is not feasible given the requirement to fully investigate a particular research area.")
		self.paragraph(r"\citen{Forrester2008,McKay2000} consider efficient sampling plans for black box experiments to improve the quality of the model produced. Both papers present Latin hypercube sampling to be an improvement on random sampling as they ensure ``that each of those components is represented in a fully stratified manner'' \cite{McKay2000} where those components refer to input dimensions. \citen{Forrester2008} extends this by optimising Latin hypercubes to result in the plan with best space fillingness. The sampling plans provided can easily be utilised in the primary planning component of the UAV tour in this project. \citen{AlexanderI.J.Forrester2009} additionally looks at adding samples to existing surrogates to improve the quality of the model produced. These papers provide the basis for optimal sampling plans for both initial data collection and subsequent flights given an existing model.

To complete this task Latin hypercubes were used to provide optimal space filling sampling plans and then the least cost route, with the path then calculated through the Latin hypercubes. To enable planning from the basis of the required energy consumption, the plane's energy consumption was modelled in a mannar where a single coefficient defines the route characteristics. This enabled a model to be produced from multiple tests that can predict the energy consumed based on the number of nodes in the Latin hypercube.

For the routing component of this project the ranking of energy cost is taken to be more important than actual cost this is acceptable.
